##  Overview

Trident Agent-An Open Source Honeypot Application Tridents Agent is an open-source honeypot application designed to enhance incident detection capabilities. It offers user-friendly landing pages, including a login interface for secure authentication and a search function to streamline inquiries. A log file stores system data with timestamps and filenames, promoting efficient diagnostics, tracing issues, and referencing logs for future purposes. The application communicates via GRPC protocol for logging events, leveraging gzip compression for efficient storage and transmission of data. Load tests are possible using the `load_test.sh` script, ensuring optimal performance under high traffic conditions. The log system employs centralized logging with structured logs for traceability, while a unit test suite validates server functionality.

| [Dockerfile](https://github.com/epyklab/trident/blob/master/agent/Dockerfile)           | The Dockerfile within `trident/agent` instructs a multi-stage container to build an executable for the application called trident." It optimizes the process by utilizing Docker's caching mechanisms and leverages separate stages for building and running the app on a Ubuntu platform.2. **Deploy & Run:** Once the trident binary is built, the final container stage is launched, with its primary responsibilities being installing necessary runtime dependencies and creating a non-privileged user to run the application. The resulting executable is copied from the build stage and executed when the container starts.3. **Ports Exposure:** The container exposes ports 5555 and 8080, allowing communication with the running application instance in other environments or services.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| [logstream.pb.go](https://github.com/epyklab/trident/blob/master/server/pkg/protobuf/logstream.pb.go)           | Import the generated protocol file for the `logstream` service (file_logstream_proto) to start using the defined message types, LogEntry and LogResponse.2. Implement the LogService method by defining input and output data structures in accordance with the specified protocol for handling log messages.3. Create a new goroutine or function that continuously reads from an appropriate data source (such as a log file) to generate the desired log messages, sending them to the provided LogService client using the generated interface.4. To compress the logstream data during transfer, make use of the provided `file_logstream_proto_rawDescGZIP()` method that will automatically compress and decompress data as necessary for transmission.5. Regularly inspect logs from the receiving side to ensure correct functioning and adapt code if issues arise during the communication process with the logstream service. |
